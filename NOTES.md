# Notes

Please add here any notes, assumptions and design decisions that might help up understand your though process.

Going to add Buy One Get One Free.

Adding product name is useful but should probably do something more reliable in terms of product creation, management, comparison etc.

Started a discount framework - one abstract class and one implementation.

Adding Discounter to Basket at construction time might need a think - should be injectable/updatable?

Need to rethink loops - got loops within loops and repeated loops.
Tendency to repeat unnecessarily.
